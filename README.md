# Data Engineering HW Redone
My improved solution to the Vinted Engineering Academy Data Engineering homework   

This is a python project, python must be installed with a compatible IDE.
Developed and tested using Visual Studio Code  

>Download the files into an empty folder. Open the folder in an IDE (such as Visual Studio).   
In the terminal, run with:  
python test1.py   (For the first task)  
python test2.py   (For the second task)   
The program will print out to the console which allows for a quick glance at the output format  
Running these commands will call the functions with the necessary inputs to complete tasks 1 and 2   

The MapReduce framework is located, fittingly, in the framework.py file.  
As the title suggests, this is not my first solution to the homework.  
This solution makes use of higher order functions to hopefully achieve more simplicity and more scalability.
Of course, it is not polished to the extent I wish it could be. There are some evident limitations in the framework as a result of inexperience and a rush to complete the task in time.
