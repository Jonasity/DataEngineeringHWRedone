# Data Engineering HW Redone
My updated solution to the Vinted Engineering Academy Data Engineering homework   

This is a python project, python must be installed with a compatible IDE.
Developed and tested using Visual Studio Code  

>Download the files into an empty folder. Open the folder in an IDE (such as Visual Studio).   
In the terminal, run with:
python test1.py (For the first task)   
Running this command will call the functions with the necessary inputs to complete tasks 1 and 2   

The MapReduce framework is located, fittingly, in the framework.py file.
